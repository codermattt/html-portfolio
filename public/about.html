<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Nyíregyháza Hungary; 
   juggling my time and focus to secure a part-time tech job throughout an intensive study program. 
   It's not easy but I am desperate to make more money while doing what I enjoy</p>

<p>By doing a bunch of online courses and projects I will be more attractive to employers. 
   Right now I am more tunnel-visioned than ever; blocking out all distractions to make the most money possible
   These uncomfortable and difficult times I know will produce a better, smarter and financially free mathew. 

</p>

<p>Angela yus web developer course is part of my path to those goals.</p>
